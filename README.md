# Bank_Management_System

In this project, I developed a Simple Bank Management Application using the C# programing langauge. 

When the application is started, the user is rpesented with the login menu. The login menu provides secured access to the banking system 
with each user having a valid username and password. These details entered by the user are crosschecked with the valid credentials available 
in the login details text document.

Once the user logs in, they are presented with the main menu. This menu is used to navigate through the various features of the bank management
system. These features are listed below.

The user can create a new account with their details and store it in a text docuemnt. 
The user can search for an existing account using the account number.
The user can deposit money into a valid account. This change is reflected in the respective account's text document.
The user can withdraw money from a valid account. This change is reflected in the respective account's text document. 
The user can display their account statement if they provide a valid account number. 
The user can delete an existing account if they know the account number.
The user can exit from the application and return to the login screen.
